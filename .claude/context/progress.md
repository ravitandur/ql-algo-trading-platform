- **Repository:** https://github.com/ravitandur/ql-algo-trading-platform.git
- **Status:** Clean working tree - all changes committed and synced with GitHub

### Recent Major Milestones
- **Epic Creation:** Options strategy lifecycle epic fully defined and decomposed
- **GitHub Integration:** Epic and all 34 tasks synced to GitHub as issues (#1-#35)
- **Task Organization:** Sequential execution model implemented with proper dependencies
- **Worktree Setup:** Development worktree created for epic implementation

### Current Epic Status: Options Strategy Lifecycle

- **Total Tasks:** 34 sequential tasks (issues #2-#35)
- **Status:** Ready for development - all tasks defined and prioritized
- **Development Branch:** `epic/options-strategy-lifecycle` in worktree `../epic-options-strategy-lifecycle`

### Recent Activity (Last 48 Hours)
1. **Project Initialization:** Set up Claude Code PM system with comprehensive configuration
2. **PRD Creation:** Comprehensive Product Requirements Document for options strategy lifecycle
3. **Epic Decomposition:** Broke down PRD into 34 actionable development tasks
4. **GitHub Sync:** Created all GitHub issues with proper linking and dependencies
5. **Configuration Updates:** Updated all tasks for Python CDK and ap-south-1 region

## Work Completed

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ…
- [x] Repository initialized with Claude Code PM system
- [x] Project rules and guidelines established in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Comprehensive .gitignore created for multi-language support
- [x] Initial commit completed and pushed to GitHub

### Phase 2: Product Definition âœ…
- [x] PRD created for options strategy lifecycle management
- [x] Epic decomposed into 34 sequential tasks
- [x] All tasks synced to GitHub as linked issues
- [x] Development worktree prepared for implementation

### Current Phase: Ready for Development ðŸš€
- **Next:** Begin Task #2 - Set up AWS CDK infrastructure stack
- **Approach:** Sequential execution through all 34 tasks
- **Technology:** Python CDK with ap-south-1 region deployment

## Outstanding Changes

### Repository Status
- **Working Directory:** Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Staging Area:** Empty
- **Untracked Files:** None

### Pending Work
- **No outstanding changes** - all work committed and pushed
- **Ready for development** on epic branch

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Start Epic Implementation
1. **Begin Task #2:** AWS CDK infrastructure setup
   - Switch to development worktree: `cd ../epic-options-strategy-lifecycle`
   - Create Python CDK project structure
   - Configure ap-south-1 region deployment

### Priority 2: Development Process Setup
2. **Establish Development Workflow:**
   - Validate Python development environment
   - Set up AWS credentials for ap-south-1 region
   - Create initial CDK project structure

### Priority 3: Task Execution
3. **Execute Sequential Tasks:**
   - Complete Task #2 (CDK infrastructure)
   - Move to Task #3 (DynamoDB schema)
   - Continue through all 34 tasks in order

## Blockers & Issues

### Current Blockers
- **None identified** - clear path forward established

### Potential Future Blockers
- **AWS Permissions:** May need AWS account setup for ap-south-1 region
- **API Access:** Will need Zerodha API credentials for broker integration
- **Dependencies:** Some tasks may reveal additional external dependencies

## Key Metrics

### Development Progress
- **Epic Completion:** 0% (ready to start)
- **Tasks Completed:** 0/34
- **GitHub Issues:** 35 total (1 epic + 34 tasks)
- **Estimated Effort:** 187 story points total

### Project Health
