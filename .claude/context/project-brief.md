# Project Brief

## Project Overview

### What It Does
**QL Algorithmic Trading Platform** is an AWS-native, event-driven system that enables systematic options trading across multiple Indian brokers. The platform automates the complete options strategy lifecycle from basket creation and strategy configuration through automated execution, real-time monitoring, and performance tracking.

### Why It Exists
The Indian algorithmic trading market lacks a comprehensive platform specifically designed for options strategies with multi-broker support. Existing solutions are either too generic for Indian markets, lack proper options-specific features, or don't provide the automation and reliability required for systematic trading at scale.

### Key Problem Solved
**Manual Trading Bottleneck:** Professional options traders currently spend 4-6 hours daily on manual execution tasks that should be automated. This platform reduces that to <1 hour while increasing execution consistency and enabling management of 10x more concurrent strategies.
