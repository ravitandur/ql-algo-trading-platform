# Project Brief

## Project Overview

### What It Does
**QL Algorithmic Trading Platform** is a comprehensive quantitative trading system that enables users to develop, test, and execute algorithmic trading strategies across multiple financial markets. The platform provides a complete trading lifecycle solution from strategy research through live execution.

### Why It Exists
The quantitative trading landscape is fragmented, with traders often cobbling together multiple tools and platforms to achieve their goals. Existing solutions either lack flexibility, have poor execution capabilities, or require extensive technical expertise. QL bridges this gap by providing a unified, powerful, yet accessible platform for algorithmic trading.

### Key Differentiators
1. **End-to-End Integration:** Complete trading lifecycle in one platform
2. **Multi-Asset Support:** Equities, futures, forex, crypto, options
3. **Risk-First Design:** Built-in risk management at every level  
4. **Real-Time Performance:** Low-latency execution and data processing
5. **Open Architecture:** Extensible and customizable framework
