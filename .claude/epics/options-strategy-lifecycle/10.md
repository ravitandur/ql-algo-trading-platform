# Task 017: Build error handling and retry mechanism

**Points:** 5  
**Type:** infrastructure task  
**Priority:** High

## Description
Build comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms for the execution engine, ensuring robust operation in the face of network issues, API failures, and other transient problems.

## Dependencies
- Task 015: Order placement service

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create centralized error handling framework
- [ ] Implement intelligent retry policies with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add circuit breaker patterns for API failures
- [ ] Create error classification and routing
- [ ] Implement dead letter queue for failed operations
- [ ] Add error notification and alerting
- [ ] Create error recovery procedures
- [ ] Handle partial failures in multi-leg strategies
- [ ] Add error metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Create manual intervention workflows

## Technical Notes
- Can be developed in parallel with position tracking
- Should handle both technical and business logic errors
- Critical for production reliability
