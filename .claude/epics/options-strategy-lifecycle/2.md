## Description

Establish the foundational AWS CDK infrastructure stack for the options strategy lifecycle platform. This includes setting up the core AWS services, networking, security groups, and deployment pipeline that will support all subsequent components.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AWS CDK project initialized with Python
- [ ] Core infrastructure stack defined (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- [ ] IAM roles and policies configured for service access
- [ ] CDK deployment pipeline configured
- [ ] Basic monitoring and logging setup (CloudWatch)
- [ ] Environment configuration for dev/staging/prod
- [ ] Infrastructure can be deployed and torn down cleanly

## Technical Details

- Use AWS CDK v2 with Python
- Create modular stack structure for different components
- Deploy to ap-south-1 (Asia Pacific - Mumbai) region
- Configure for Indian market data residency requirements
- Set up proper tagging strategy for resource management
- Configure appropriate security policies following principle of least privilege
- Establish naming conventions for all AWS resources
- Create parameter store entries for configuration management

## Dependencies

None - This is the foundational task that all other tasks depend on.

## Effort Estimate

5 story points - Setup task requiring infrastructure knowledge but well-documented patterns.

## Definition of Done

- CDK project successfully deploys to AWS
- All core infrastructure components are created
- Basic monitoring dashboards are functional
- Documentation includes deployment instructions
- Infrastructure passes security review checklist
- Cleanup scripts work correctly
