# Stream B: Network & Security Infrastructure

## Scope
VPC, subnets, security groups, and networking components

## Files
- `infrastructure/stacks/networking_stack.py`
- `infrastructure/constructs/vpc_construct.py`
- `infrastructure/stacks/security_stack.py`

## Progress

### Completed ✅
- **Created modular NetworkingStack** (`infrastructure/stacks/networking_stack.py`):
  - Extracted networking components from main stack into dedicated module
  - Implemented VPC creation with configurable CIDR blocks and AZ configuration
  - Added VPC Flow Logs for security monitoring and compliance
  - Created Parameter Store entries for network resource references
  - Added CloudFormation outputs for cross-stack dependencies
  - Supports multi-environment configuration (dev/staging/prod)

- **Created reusable VPC construct** (`infrastructure/constructs/vpc_construct.py`):
  - Developed `OptionsStrategyVPC` construct for consistent VPC creation
  - Implemented multi-tier subnet architecture (public, private app, private DB)
  - Added cost optimization features (single NAT gateway for dev, multiple for prod)
  - Implemented comprehensive tagging strategy for Indian market compliance
  - Added utility methods for subnet access by type
  - Configured DNS settings and DHCP options

- **Created dedicated SecurityStack** (`infrastructure/stacks/security_stack.py`):
  - Implemented layered security groups for different service tiers:
    - ALB security group for internet-facing load balancers
    - Application security group for app services and Lambda functions
    - Database security group for RDS and cache services
    - Management security group for bastion/admin access
    - Internal security group for service-to-service communication
  - Added Network ACLs for production environments (optional)
  - Implemented principle of least privilege access rules
  - Created helper methods for dynamic security group management

- **Refactored main infrastructure stack** (`infrastructure/app.py`):
  - Updated `OptionsStrategyPlatformStack` to use modular components
  - Maintained IAM roles and policies for Lambda and ECS services
  - Kept CloudWatch log groups and monitoring dashboard
  - Updated Parameter Store entries for infrastructure references
  - Preserved all CloudFormation outputs for backward compatibility

- **Updated main application entry point** (`app.py`):
  - Enhanced environment configuration to pass VPC CIDR and AZ settings
  - Added support for environment-specific networking parameters
  - Maintained multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
  - Preserved ap-south-1 region configuration for Indian market compliance

- **Created module initialization files**:
  - Added `__init__.py` files for proper Python module structure
  - Exported public classes and functions for easy importing
  - Added version information and documentation

### Key Features Implemented
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of networking and security concerns
- **Reusability**: VPC construct can be reused across different stacks/environments
- **Cost Optimization**: Environment-specific configurations (dev uses 2 AZs, prod uses 3)
- **Security**: Layered security with security groups and optional NACLs
- **Compliance**: Maintained ap-south-1 region and Indian market data residency
- **Monitoring**: VPC Flow Logs and CloudWatch integration
- **Configuration Management**: Parameter Store integration for runtime configuration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and type hints throughout

### Technical Decisions
- Used composition over inheritance for modular stack design
- Implemented construct pattern for reusable VPC component
- Added environment-specific security configurations
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing CloudFormation outputs
- Used explicit import statements for better dependency management

## Deliverables
All Stream B deliverables have been completed successfully:

1. **infrastructure/stacks/networking_stack.py** - Complete modular networking stack
2. **infrastructure/constructs/vpc_construct.py** - Reusable VPC construct 
3. **infrastructure/stacks/security_stack.py** - Dedicated security infrastructure
4. **Updated infrastructure/app.py** - Refactored to use modular components
5. **Updated app.py** - Enhanced with environment-specific configuration

## Commit
- **Hash**: 178db92
- **Message**: "Issue #2: Modularize networking and security infrastructure into separate stacks"
- **Files**: 7 files modified (1188 insertions, 205 deletions)

## Integration Status
✅ **Ready for other streams**: The modular infrastructure is fully functional and ready for other streams to build upon:
- Networking components are properly modularized and reusable
- Security groups are configured for all service layers
- Parameter Store entries are available for resource references
- CloudFormation outputs maintain compatibility with existing dependencies
- Multi-environment support is fully preserved

Stream B work is completed successfully. The infrastructure now has a clean modular architecture that will be easier to maintain and extend as the platform grows.
