# Stream A: Core CDK Project Setup

## Scope
CDK project initialization, project structure, and basic configuration

## Files
- `cdk.json`
- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `setup.py`
- `infrastructure/__init__.py`
- `infrastructure/app.py`

## Progress

### Completed âœ…
- Created `cdk.json` with CDK v2 configuration and ap-south-1 region settings
- Created `requirements.txt` with CDK v2 dependencies and development tools
- Created `setup.py` for Python project configuration with proper metadata
- Created `infrastructure/__init__.py` module with version info and exports
- Implemented `infrastructure/app.py` with comprehensive OptionsStrategyPlatformStack:
  - VPC with multi-AZ public/private/isolated subnets for high availability
  - Security groups for ALB, application, database, and cache layers
  - IAM roles and policies following principle of least privilege
  - CloudWatch log groups and VPC Flow Logs for monitoring
  - Parameter Store entries for configuration management
  - Resource tagging for Indian market data residency compliance
  - CloudFormation outputs for cross-stack references
- Created `app.py` main entry point with multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
- Committed all changes with detailed commit message

### Key Features Implemented
- **Region Compliance**: Configured for ap-south-1 (Asia Pacific - Mumbai) region
- **Security**: Implemented layered security groups and IAM least privilege
- **Monitoring**: VPC Flow Logs, CloudWatch log groups, and monitoring dashboard
- **Multi-Environment**: Support for dev, staging, and prod environments
- **Modularity**: Clean separation between app entry point and infrastructure stack
- **Configuration Management**: Parameter Store integration for runtime configuration
- **Cost Optimization**: Environment-specific AZ configuration (2 for dev/staging, 3 for prod)

### Technical Decisions
- Used CDK v2 with Python for better performance and feature support
- Configured VPC with /16 CIDR allowing for future growth
- Implemented isolated subnets for database security
- Added comprehensive tagging strategy for cost allocation and compliance
- Included VPC Flow Logs for security auditing and monitoring

## Commit
- **Hash**: a9f8d2b
- **Message**: "Issue #2: Create foundational CDK project structure"
- **Files**: 6 files added (764 insertions)

## Ready for Next Streams
The foundational CDK structure is now complete and ready for other streams to build upon:
- VPC and networking infrastructure is established
- Security groups are configured for different service layers
- IAM roles are ready for Lambda and ECS services
- Parameter Store structure is in place for configuration
- CloudWatch logging is configured for monitoring

All deliverables for Stream A are completed successfully.
