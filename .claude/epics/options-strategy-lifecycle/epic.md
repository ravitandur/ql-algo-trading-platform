# Epic: Options Strategy Lifecycle

## Summary
Implementation of a complete options strategy lifecycle management system that allows users to define, execute, and manage options baskets and strategies through automated EventBridge-driven execution with Zerodha broker integration.

## Business Value
Enables algorithmic options trading with automated execution, reducing manual intervention while providing systematic approach to options strategy management. This forms the core trading engine of the platform, directly enabling revenue generation through user subscriptions and transaction fees.

## User Stories

### Admin Stories
- As an admin, I want to create marketplace baskets so that users can subscribe to proven strategies
- As an admin, I want to manage strategy templates so that users have standardized options
- As an admin, I want to monitor system health so that I can ensure reliable execution

### Trader Stories
- As a trader, I want to create custom baskets so that I can implement my trading strategies
- As a trader, I want to subscribe to marketplace baskets so that I can use proven strategies
- As a trader, I want to configure strategy parameters so that I can customize entry/exit conditions
- As a trader, I want to link multiple broker accounts so that I can diversify execution
- As a trader, I want to monitor my positions so that I can track performance

### System Stories
- As the system, I want to execute strategies automatically so that trades happen without manual intervention
- As the system, I want to manage order lifecycle so that I can track execution status
- As the system, I want to sync with broker APIs so that I can maintain accurate position data

## Technical Approach
Event-driven architecture using AWS services in ap-south-1 region:
- **EventBridge** for time-based strategy triggers
- **Lambda** for execution logic and broker integration
- **DynamoDB** for data persistence (orders, positions, strategies)
- **Step Functions** for complex workflow orchestration
- **SQS** for async processing and error handling
- **CDK (Python)** for infrastructure as code
- **Parquet** for historical orders and positions
- **Region:** ap-south-1 (Asia Pacific - Mumbai) for optimal latency to Indian markets
- **Development Stack:** Python for all Lambda functions and CDK infrastructure
