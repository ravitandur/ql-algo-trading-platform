# Task 031: Optimize execution latency

**Points:** 3  
**Type:** Optimization  
**Dependencies:** [015, 017] (needs order placement and error handling)  
**Parallel:** true

## Description
Optimize the system to minimize execution latency for time-sensitive options trading operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Benchmark current system latency across all components
- [ ] Optimize database queries and connection pooling
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize network communication protocols
- [ ] Reduce memory allocations and garbage collection
- [ ] Implement async processing where appropriate
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for latency tracking
- [ ] Document performance improvements achieved
- [ ] Set up automated performance regression testing

## Technical Notes
- Focus on order placement, market data processing, and risk calculations
- Consider using memory-mapped files for high-frequency data
- Implement connection pooling and keep-alive mechanisms
- Profile application to identify bottlenecks
- Target sub-100ms execution for critical paths
