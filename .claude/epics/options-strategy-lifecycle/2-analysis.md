# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #2

## Overview
Establish foundational AWS CDK infrastructure stack with Python, covering core networking, security, monitoring, and deployment pipeline setup. This is a foundational task requiring systematic infrastructure setup across multiple AWS service domains.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core CDK Project Setup
**Scope**: CDK project initialization, project structure, and basic configuration
**Files**:
- `cdk.json`
- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `setup.py`
- `infrastructure/__init__.py`
- `infrastructure/app.py`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Network & Security Infrastructure
**Scope**: VPC, subnets, security groups, and networking components
**Files**:
- `infrastructure/stacks/networking_stack.py`
- `infrastructure/constructs/vpc_construct.py`
- `infrastructure/stacks/security_stack.py`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes basic structure
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: Stream A (CDK project structure)

### Stream C: IAM & Configuration Management
**Scope**: IAM roles, policies, Parameter Store, and security configuration
**Files**:
- `infrastructure/stacks/iam_stack.py`
- `infrastructure/constructs/iam_construct.py`
- `infrastructure/stacks/config_stack.py`
- `config/environments.py`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes basic structure
**Estimated Hours**: 2.5
**Dependencies**: Stream A (CDK project structure)

### Stream D: Monitoring & Deployment Pipeline
**Scope**: CloudWatch setup, deployment scripts, and environment configuration
**Files**:
- `infrastructure/stacks/monitoring_stack.py`
- `scripts/deploy.sh`
- `scripts/destroy.sh`
- `docs/deployment.md`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Streams B & C are established
**Estimated Hours**: 2.5
**Dependencies**: Stream B (networking), Stream C (IAM)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `infrastructure/app.py` - All streams contribute stack imports
- `requirements.txt` - Multiple streams add CDK dependencies
- `config/environments.py` - Shared environment configuration

### Sequential Requirements
1. CDK project structure before any stack implementation
2. Basic networking before security groups
3. IAM roles before service-specific policies
4. Core infrastructure before monitoring setup

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Different streams work on separate stack files
- **Medium Risk**: Coordination needed for main app.py imports and requirements.txt
- **High Risk**: None - well-separated concerns

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Stream A first (30 minutes), then launch Streams B & C in parallel once basic CDK structure exists. Stream D starts when B & C are substantially complete to avoid dependency conflicts.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 4 hours (A: 2h → B,C: 3h parallel → D: 2.5h)
- Total work: 10 hours
- Efficiency gain: 60%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 10 hours (sequential execution)

## Notes
- Stream A should establish consistent Python project structure and CDK patterns
- Use ap-south-1 region consistently across all stacks
- Follow AWS CDK v2 best practices for modular stack design
- Ensure proper tagging strategy is established early and used consistently
- All stacks should support multiple environments (dev/staging/prod) from the start
- Security policies should follow principle of least privilege throughout
