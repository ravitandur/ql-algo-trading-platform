# Task 012: Implement strategy execution scheduler

**Points:** 8  
**Type:** orchestration task  
**Priority:** High (core execution logic)

## Description
Implement the core strategy execution scheduler that orchestrates the evaluation and execution of options strategies. This component serves as the central coordinator for strategy lifecycle management.

## Dependencies
- Task 005: EventBridge event handling infrastructure
- Task 007: Strategy CRUD operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create scheduler service that manages strategy execution timing
- [ ] Implement strategy queue management
- [ ] Add execution state tracking
- [ ] Create execution logging and monitoring
- [ ] Handle concurrent strategy executions
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown procedures
- [ ] Add configuration for execution intervals
- [ ] Create health check endpoints

## Technical Notes
- This is a critical path component that other execution tasks depend on
- Must be robust and handle failures gracefully
- Should support both scheduled and event-driven executions
