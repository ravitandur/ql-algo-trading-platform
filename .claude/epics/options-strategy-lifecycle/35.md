# Task 024: Design broker abstraction layer

**Story Points:** 5
**Task Type:** Architecture
**Priority:** High

## Description
Design and implement a comprehensive broker abstraction layer that provides a unified interface for interacting with different broker APIs (Zerodha, Angel, Finvasia, etc.). This abstraction layer will standardize order placement, portfolio management, market data access, and account operations across all supported brokers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define standardized broker interface contracts
- [ ] Create base broker adapter classes
- [ ] Implement common data models for orders, positions, and market data
- [ ] Design configuration system for broker-specific parameters
- [ ] Create error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Implement broker capability detection (what features each broker supports)
- [ ] Design authentication and connection management patterns
- [ ] Create broker factory and registry system

## Dependencies
- **Task 004:** Implement Zerodha broker integration (needed as reference implementation)

## Technical Notes
- Use Strategy pattern for broker implementations
- Ensure thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Design for extensibility to add new brokers easily
- Consider rate limiting and API throttling requirements
- Plan for broker-specific feature differences

## Definition of Done
- Broker abstraction interfaces defined and documented
- Base implementation classes created
- Configuration system implemented
- Unit tests covering all interface methods
- Documentation for adding new broker implementations
- Code review completed and approved
