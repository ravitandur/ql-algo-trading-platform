# Task 027: Create broker account linking system

**Story Points:** 5
**Task Type:** User Management
**Priority:** High

## Description
Develop a system that allows users to link multiple broker accounts to their platform profile. This includes secure credential storage, account verification, and management of multiple active broker connections per user.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create database schema for storing broker account associations
- [ ] Implement secure credential encryption and storage
- [ ] Create broker account linking workflow and UI
- [ ] Implement account verification and connection testing
- [ ] Add support for multiple accounts per broker type
- [ ] Create account status monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Implement account unlinking and credential updates
- [ ] Add audit logging for account operations
- [ ] Create account selection interface for trading operations
- [ ] Handle broker account switching during active sessions

## Dependencies
- **Task 003:** Implement user authentication system (provides user management foundation)
- **Task 024:** Design broker abstraction layer (provides broker interfaces)

## Technical Notes
- Use strong encryption for storing broker credentials
- Implement secure key management and rotation
- Design for scalability with multiple users and accounts
- Consider credential expiration and renewal workflows
- Plan for broker-specific authentication requirements

## Security Considerations
- Encrypt all broker credentials at rest
- Use secure protocols for credential transmission
- Implement access controls and user permissions
- Add session timeout and automatic logout
- Audit all credential access and modifications

## Definition of Done
- Database schema created and migrated
- Account linking workflow implemented and tested
- Security measures validated through security review
- Multiple account scenarios tested
- User interface functional and intuitive
- Integration tests covering all linking scenarios
- Code review completed and approved
