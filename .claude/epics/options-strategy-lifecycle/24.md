# Task 028: Build cross-broker execution capabilities

**Story Points:** 8
**Task Type:** Complex Orchestration
**Priority:** Medium

## Description
Implement sophisticated cross-broker execution capabilities that can execute complex options strategies across multiple brokers simultaneously. This includes intelligent broker selection, order routing, execution monitoring, and consolidated reporting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement intelligent broker selection algorithm
- [ ] Create cross-broker order routing and distribution
- [ ] Build execution orchestration engine
- [ ] Implement consolidated position and P&L tracking
- [ ] Create cross-broker risk management controls
- [ ] Build execution monitoring and status tracking
- [ ] Implement failure handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Create cross-broker reconciliation system
- [ ] Add performance analytics and execution quality metrics
- [ ] Build unified reporting across all linked brokers

## Dependencies
- **Task 025:** Implement Angel broker integration (provides Angel capabilities)
- **Task 026:** Implement Finvasia broker integration (provides Finvasia capabilities)  
- **Task 027:** Create broker account linking system (provides multi-account access)

## Technical Notes
- Design for high availability and fault tolerance
- Implement proper transaction management across brokers
- Handle timing differences and latency variations
- Consider broker-specific limitations and capabilities
- Plan for partial execution scenarios and cleanup

## Execution Scenarios
- Split large orders across multiple brokers
- Route different legs of strategies to different brokers
- Implement best execution routing based on liquidity
- Handle broker failures with automatic failover
- Manage complex multi-leg options strategies

## Definition of Done
- Cross-broker execution engine implemented and tested
- Intelligent routing algorithms functional
- Consolidated tracking and reporting working
- Failure scenarios handled gracefully
- Performance meets latency requirements
- Integration tests covering complex execution scenarios
- Load testing completed successfully
- Code review completed and approved
