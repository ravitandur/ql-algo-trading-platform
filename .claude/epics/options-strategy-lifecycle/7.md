## Description

Establish AWS EventBridge infrastructure for scheduling and orchestrating time-based operations in the options trading platform. This includes market data updates, strategy evaluations, order management, and system maintenance tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EventBridge custom event bus created via CDK (Python)
- [ ] Scheduled rules for market hours operations configured
- [ ] Event patterns defined for trading lifecycle events
- [ ] Lambda functions connected as event targets
- [ ] Dead letter queues configured for failed events
- [ ] Event monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Event replay capability implemented
- [ ] Integration with other AWS services (SQS, SNS, Lambda)

## Technical Details

- Create custom EventBridge bus for trading platform events
- Set up scheduled rules using cron expressions for Indian market timings (IST)
- Configure for ap-south-1 region deployment
- Define event schemas for type safety and validation
- Implement event-driven architecture patterns
- Configure proper IAM permissions for event publishing/consuming
- Set up EventBridge Pipes for event transformation
- Create monitoring dashboards for event processing metrics
- Implement event archival and replay for disaster recovery

## Dependencies

- Task 004: Zerodha integration provides market data events to schedule

## Effort Estimate

5 story points - Infrastructure task with moderate complexity requiring understanding of event-driven patterns.

## Definition of Done

- EventBridge infrastructure is deployed and operational
- Scheduled events trigger Lambda functions correctly
- Event patterns match and route events properly
- Failed events are captured in dead letter queues
- Monitoring shows event processing metrics
- Event schemas are validated on publish
- Documentation covers event architecture and usage
- Integration tests verify end-to-end event flow
