# Task 014: Build exit condition evaluation engine

**Points:** 5  
**Type:** logic task  
**Priority:** High

## Description
Build the engine that evaluates exit conditions for options strategies, determining when positions should be closed based on profit targets, stop losses, time decay, and other configured criteria.

## Dependencies
- Task 012: Strategy execution scheduler

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create exit condition evaluation framework
- [ ] Implement profit/loss threshold checks
- [ ] Support time-based exit conditions
- [ ] Add volatility-based exit logic
- [ ] Implement Greeks-based exit conditions
- [ ] Create emergency exit mechanisms
- [ ] Add condition evaluation logging
- [ ] Support partial position exits

## Technical Notes
- Independent from entry conditions, can be developed in parallel
- Should handle multiple exit criteria simultaneously
- Critical for risk management
