## Description

Design and implement a comprehensive DynamoDB schema to support the core entities of the options trading platform: baskets, strategies, orders, and positions. The schema must support efficient queries for real-time trading operations and historical analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] DynamoDB tables designed for baskets, strategies, orders, positions
- [ ] Proper partition and sort key design for optimal performance
- [ ] Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) configured for common query patterns
- [ ] Data access patterns documented and optimized
- [ ] Python data classes and models defined
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations implemented
- [ ] Data validation and error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (sub-100ms queries)

## Technical Details

- Use single-table design where appropriate for related entities
- Implement proper data modeling for time-series data (positions/orders)
- Configure appropriate read/write capacity or on-demand billing
- Set up DynamoDB Streams for event-driven architecture
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Create data migration scripts for schema updates
- Use AWS CDK (Python) for DynamoDB stack deployment
- Use boto3 for DynamoDB operations
- Configure tables in ap-south-1 region for data residency compliance

## Dependencies

- Task 001: AWS CDK infrastructure stack must be deployed first

## Effort Estimate

8 story points - Complex database design requiring deep understanding of DynamoDB patterns and trading domain knowledge.

## Definition of Done

- All DynamoDB tables are created via CDK
- CRUD operations work for all entities
- Query performance meets SLA requirements
- Data model handles all identified use cases
- Unit tests cover all database operations
- Documentation includes schema design rationale
- Data validation prevents invalid states
