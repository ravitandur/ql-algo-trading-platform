**Parallel:** true

## Description
Build a comprehensive health check and alerting system to proactively monitor system health and notify stakeholders of issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create dependency health checks (database, external APIs)
- [ ] Set up automated alerting rules and thresholds
- [ ] Implement escalation procedures for critical alerts
- [ ] Create health status dashboard
- [ ] Add synthetic transaction monitoring
- [ ] Implement alert fatigue prevention (deduplication, rate limiting)
- [ ] Set up multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, Slack)
- [ ] Create runbooks for common alert scenarios

## Technical Notes

- Implement both shallow and deep health checks
- Use different alert severity levels (info, warning, critical)
- Consider business hours vs off-hours alerting rules
- Integrate with PagerDuty or similar incident management tools
