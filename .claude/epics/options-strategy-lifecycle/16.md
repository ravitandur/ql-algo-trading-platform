# Task 013: Build entry condition evaluation engine

**Points:** 8  
**Type:** logic task  
**Priority:** High

## Description
Build the engine that evaluates entry conditions for options strategies, determining when positions should be opened based on configured criteria and market conditions.

## Dependencies
- Task 012: Strategy execution scheduler

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create entry condition evaluation framework
- [ ] Implement market data integration for condition checks
- [ ] Support multiple condition types (technical indicators, price levels, volatility, etc.)
- [ ] Add condition composition logic (AND, OR operations)
- [ ] Implement condition result caching for performance
- [ ] Create condition evaluation logging
- [ ] Add backtesting support for entry conditions
- [ ] Handle real-time vs delayed data scenarios

## Technical Notes
- Can be developed in parallel with exit condition engine
- Should be modular to support different condition types
- Performance is critical for real-time evaluation
